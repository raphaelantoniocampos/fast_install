## Usage

### Clone the Repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/raphaelantoniocampos/autopkg-windows
cd autopkg-windows
```

### Install uv if already not installed

To install uv follow the [instructions](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation). 

### Prepare the JSON file

- The data directory already includes an example JSON file for you to use:

    - **packages.json**: A list of general-purpose packagelications.

- You can modify these files or create your own JSON file with the following format:

```json
[
    {
        "package_manager": "Winget",
        "name": "Google Chrome",
        "package_name": ["Google.Chrome"]
    }
]
```

- You can also include batch scripts using Custom as the package manager:

```json
[
    {
        "package_manager": "Custom",
        "name": "Winget Update All",
        "package_name": [
            "powershell", 
            "winget", 
            "update", 
            "--all"
        ]
    }
]
```


### Run the Script

- Run the script by passing the JSON file path as an argument:

```
uv run .\main.py .\data\packages.json
```

### Run in silent mode

- If you want to run the script in silent mode use *--silent*. (Runs installations without user interaction):

```
uv run .\main.py .\data\packages.json --silent
```

---

### Generate an Executable (Optional)

- To create a standalone executable, use the build flag:

```
uv run .\main.py .\data\packages.json --build
```

- The generated executable will be located in dist/autopkg-windows.exe. 

- Also supports silent mode

```
uv run .\main.py .\data\packages.json --silent --build
```
